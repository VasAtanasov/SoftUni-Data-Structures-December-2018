# **Implement AVL Tree Deletion**

### **Extend your AVL Tree to support:**

- void DeleteMin() - deletes the minimum element (balances the tree if necessary) 
- void Delete(T item) - deletes the given element (balances the tree if necessary)

You are given a skeleton with additional tests that cover delete operations.
